# Assumptions

Decisions that the M5 dataset does not provide. Every phase uses these values.

## 1. Scope

- store: CA_1
- items: department FOODS_3
- why: one store keeps runtime low; food items mix fast movers and intermittent items, which test both forecasting and inventory methods

## 2. Forecast horizon

- 28 days ahead
- why: same horizon as the original dataset competition, so results are comparable

## 3. Review policy

- periodic review, once per week
- why: matches how most retailers place orders

## 4. Service target

- base case: 95% cycle service level
- sensitivity cases: 90% and 98%

## 5. Costs

- holding cost: 25% of item price per year (price x 0.25 / 365 per unit per day)
- lost-sales penalty: per unit not sold because of a stockout
- fixed ordering cost: per order placed
- why: holding cost as a % of price is a standard textbook assumption; the other two are calibrated once the inventory model exists.

## 6. Lead times

- distribution centre to store: 3 to 7 days, random within that range
- why: realistic for a regional DC; the variability tests safety stock

## 7. Data notes

- scope after cleaning: 823 items, 1,280,182 rows (317,261 pre-launch rows dropped), 2011-01-29 to 2016-05-22.
- days before each item's first price were dropped (not launched yet).
- 25 December: store closed every year (zero sales); treated separately, not as demand.
- zero-sales runs: 247 of 295 items selling 2+ units/day have runs of 14+ zero days (654 runs of 14–60 days, 308 runs over 60 days). Treated as unavailability (censored demand), not zero demand. Flagged with an `available` column in Phase 1.
